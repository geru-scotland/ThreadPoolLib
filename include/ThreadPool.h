     * @brief AddTask function template.
     *
     * This function adds tasks to the queue by emplacing them directly
     * into the queue's memory, bypassing the need for copy construction.
     *
     * It employs perfect forwarding, meaning it preserves the original "value category"
     * (either lvalue or rvalue) of the passed arguments.
     *
     * Optimization note: An alternative approach would be to create a variable (say, a function wrapper),
     * then convert it to an rvalue using std::move, so it's moved instead of copied:
     *
     * 1. FunctionWrapper task = std::bind(...), and then
     * 2. tasks_.push(std::move(task))
     *
     * After the move, the content of the 'task' variable would be in an unspecified state,
     * as it's an rvalue, essentially a temporary or unnamed content in memory. Note that
     * both push and push_back methods copy the argument if it's an lvalue.
